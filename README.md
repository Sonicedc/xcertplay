# xcertplay

English | [中文](README.zh-CN.md)

`xcertplay` is an Android head-unit CarPlay receiver. It supports connecting to
the MFI chip through a CH341 I2C bridge or directly through the board's I2C
controller, and supports both wired and wireless CarPlay connections.

> Still under active development.

## Features

- CarPlay host applications for Android and Android Automotive OS.
- Support for MFI chips connected through a CH341 bridge or native
  `/dev/i2c-N` devices.
- Wired and wireless CarPlay connections.
- CarPlay Ultra triggering (the protocol stack is untested/incomplete, but it
  can trigger the CarPlay Ultra prompt on an iPhone).
- Voice, navigation, and music multi-channel audio output mapped to the
  corresponding Android channels.
- Dynamic Activity resizing with automatic re-handshaking to the new
  resolution.
- Vehicle head-unit location reporting.
- Android 9 (API 28) support.

## Current progress

It works 👍. It has been tested on car head units and phones. If you encounter
an incompatible car head unit, please open an issue and attach your log from
`/sdcard/Android/data/com.shilapi.xcertplay/files/logs/xcertplay.log`.

## Project structure

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `common/` | Shared CarPlay host activity, settings UI, persistence, and app resources used by both targets. |
| `mobile/` | Standard Android target using the shared CarPlay host UI. |
| `automotive/` | Android Automotive OS target with the shared host UI and advanced audio channel mapping. |
| `shared/` | Car App Library code plus the CH341, I2C, MFi, iPhone, iAP2, NCM, VPN, AirPlay, and media implementations. |

## Requirements

- JDK 17 or newer to launch Gradle. The daemon resolves Java 25 through the
  Gradle toolchain.
- Android SDK Platform 37.
- Android 9 (API 28) or newer.
  On Android 9, Wi-Fi P2P 5 GHz mode is unavailable and LocalOnlyHotspot is used instead.
- Android NDK `28.2.13676358`.
- A physical USB Host/OTG Android device and MFi hardware are required for
  hardware validation.
